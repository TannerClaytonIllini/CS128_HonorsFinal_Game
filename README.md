Project Intro:
  I'm going to recreate a minimal version of BlackJack.
  As a solo project for a final worth of my grade I wanted something to refine my technical skills and explore what can be done but was with my realm of reasonable confindence, esspessically for a language I'm very new to.
  Main:
  -Successfully Implement a funcitonal, bugfree Blackjack version in Rust.
  -Singular BlackJack Hand
  -'House' Hand of some form
  -Score Traker
  -Adustable number of decks in play.
  Secondary:
  -Implement multipule players. maybe without a house. Locally
  -Implement Network multiplayer.

System Overview:
  Main:
  -Implement Deck of Cards
  -Implement BlackJack Condidtions
  -
  

Foreseeable Challenges:
  -General Challeange. I have found myself confused in many areas of Rust. While they clear up they will probably come up quite often working on non template material.
