Project Intro:
  We're going to recreate a minimal version of BlackJack.
  The project with our current skills we felt comforable with a final worth of wait on a project we were reallatively confident in.
  Main:
  -Successfully Implement a funcitonal, bugfree Blackjack version in Rust.
  -BlackJack Hand(s)
  -Some options or stats

System Overview:
  Main:
  -Implement Deck of Cards
  -Implement BlackJack Condidtions
  -Deck of Cards
  -Black Jack Conditions
  -Successfully Implement a funcitonal, bugfree Blackjack version in Rust.
  -Singular BlackJack Hand
  -Player controls
  -Score Traker
  -Adustable number of decks in play.
  
  Secondary/Optional:
  -Implement House Hand. = vs AI
  -Implement multipule players. maybe without a house. Locally
  -Implement Network multiplayer.
  

Foreseeable Challenges:
  -General Challeange. This should be the biggest challenge. I have found myself confused in many areas of Rust. While they clear up they will probably come up quite often working on non template material.
  -Depending oh how we design the 'AI' I could be very easy or very challenging.
  -If we get to multiplayer. I don't think any of us have networking experince.
  -Depending on design and rule choices. threads. Basic rules threads aren't nessary. if they are changed to say anyone can draw without an order then threads may be nessary.
